SCRIPTS
-------

In this path you can see some examples of how this image can be used
on any host, in order to provide container wrapper tools and services
that can be run anywhere on the host.

The purpose of these examples is generaly to offer a small bash script
to replace a toolset, instead of requiring that the toolset be installed
locally.

For example:  run composer on any host path, without installing php
